Chong,  this is very well written and explained.  I really appreciate the mushroom graphic to aid in the understanding of the features. 

Your descriptions of how the algorithms work are very good.  I think you understand svm and random forests much better than most students. 

I don't really understand what you did with the feature ranking.  I'm surprised that it improved the performance of the SVM.  One other thing is that you give a table of what I think are cross-validation scores.  That's useful to know but where are the test set scores?  

When I played around with this dataset I was also getting accuracy scores of 100%.  That's really amazing consider that there are 8000 datapoints.  Fortunately there seem to be good methods for detecting poisonous mushrooms!

I wonder if you could produce a human readable decision tree that works with high accuracy?
